# IT Survival Kit
A set of tools and quick reference for various technologies. The objective is to systematize resources and functions for daily use.

* A pragmatic approach is taken: if there are two ways to do something, only one is presented. Preference is given to easier and more robust solutions, with less needs for installation or use of 3rd-part software.

* Most code presented here are not presented as functional and integrated software, but as a descriptive set of features and functions. In general, you should take parts of code and combine them for personal use.
