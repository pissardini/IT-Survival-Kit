# IT Survival Kit
A set of tools and quick reference for various technologies. The goal is to systematize resources and functions for daily use.

* The focus is on general-purpose features actually used in everyday programming.

* A pragmatic approach is taken: if there are two ways to do something, only one is presented (usually the simplest). Preference is given to easier and more robust solutions, with less needs for installation or use of 3rd-part software.

* Most code presented here are not presented as functional and integrated software, but as a descriptive set of features and functions. In general, you should copy parts of code and combine them for personal use. In markdown  files, download the contents and use your text editor to find the convenient commands.
